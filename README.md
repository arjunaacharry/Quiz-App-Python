# Simple Quiz Game in Python

This is a basic console-based quiz game implemented in Python. The game presents the player with three multiple-choice questions, and the player has three attempts to answer each question. Each correct answer earns the player 1 mark.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arjunaacharry/Quiz-App-Python.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Quiz-App-Python
    ```

3. Run the quiz game:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Answer each question by entering the letter corresponding to your choice. You have three attempts for each question.

5. After answering all three questions, the game will display your total score out of 3.

## Customize the Questions

If you want to customize the questions, answer options, or correct answers, you can do so by modifying the `main.py` file. Open the file in a text editor and locate the `quiz_game` function, where the questions are defined.

Feel free to add more questions, change the options, or customize the game according to your preferences.
